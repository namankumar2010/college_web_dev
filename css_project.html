 Social networking sites are a great platform for people to connect with their loved ones.
 It helps in increasing communication and making connections with people all over the world. Although people believe
 that social networking sites are harmful, they are also very beneficial.<br>
Furthermore, we can classify social networking sites as per blogging, vlogging, podcasting and more. 
We use social networking sites for various uses. It helps us greatly; however, it also is very dangerous.

<li><h2><em> Famous Social Networking Sites :-</em></h2></li>
</ul>

<h4> Facebook :- </h4>

<p class="p2">
For instance, Facebook is the largest social networking site. 
It has more than 1 billion users which keep increasing every day.
 Moreover, it also helps you promote your business or brand through ads.
</p>

<h4> Instagram :- </h4>

<p class="p3">
Secondly, there is Instagram. It is owned by Facebook only.
 Similarly, this app allows you to share photos and videos with 
 your followers. It gives users a lot of filters to beautify your photos.
</p>

<h4 > Twitter:- </h4>

<p class="p4">
Furthermore, Twitter is also a great social networking site. 
It is mostly used by celebrities. This site allows you to post 
short messages called tweets to share your thoughts. Twitter is a 
great platform to convey your message in limited words.

<h4 > LinkedIn:- </h4>

<p class="p5">
Moreover, we have LinkedIn. This is one of the most sought after 
sites which allow professionals to locate and hire employees.
 Subsequently, it is available in more than twenty languages to
 give a user-friendly interface.
 </p>
 
 <h4 > WhatsApp:- </h4>

<p class="p6">
Finally, we have WhatsApp. Though it entered the game quite late,
 this instant messaging app made a place for itself instantaneously.
 Facebook acquired this app as well. It allows you to share text
 messages, images, videos, audios, documents and more.<br>

In short, social networking sites are a bane and a boon.
 It depends on us how we use to. Anything in excess is harmful; 
 likewise, social networking sites are too. Use them for your benefit
 and do not let them control your life.
